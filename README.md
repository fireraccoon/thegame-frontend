> A Vue.js project


Backend project: https://github.com/jwillp/thegame-backend

## Description
The initial goal of this project was to create a platform that allowed my friends and I to create games of challenges. These games could last a week, a summer or even a year, mostly in the context of sport. For instance we'd have some Parkour/Freerun related challenges like The one who did the most front flips or back flips etc. For each challenge there would be a number of points associated with each completion of a challenge. The winner being the one with the msot points at the end of the game's duration. 

The first version was a classic web app with html pages. In order to learn how to create a RESTfulish API using Symfony and a single page app using Vue.js I created a new version of the project which is divided into 2 repositories: [frontend](https://github.com/jwillp/thegame-frontend) & [backend](https://github.com/jwillp/thegame-backend).

Here are the currently implemented features (both backend & frontend):

Note: A Game should be seen as a container of challenges. It is like a competition with many challenges.
